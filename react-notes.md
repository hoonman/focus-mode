# React concepts nodes
* state: data that your component remembers and can change
    * ex. light bulb switching ON or OFF
    * ex. toggling a certain mode ON or OFF 
    
* lifecycle method: special moment in a component's life where you can run code. key events that happen in your component
    1. mounting: when the component is first created and added
    2. updating: when the component re-renders because state or props changed
    3. unmounting: when the component is removed from the screen 

* props: how parent pass info to child components 

* hooks: functions that allow you to "hook int" react features 
    * useState: used when we want state in our variables
    * useEffect: runs code after component initialization
